It will help set the default filter option with BuddyPress Activity, and It will also allow removing some specific activity types from activities. It also allows posting certain public CPT-type activities using a simple enable option. If you have an event post type, you qualify to post a simple activity update inside BuddyPress activities [reference](https://codex.buddypress.org/plugindev/post-types-activities/).


== Description ==

Admin can set default and customized activities to be listed on the front-end.
It will also allow setting your default option for activities. You can change the default from everything to Post Updates. The plugin also allows you to enable activities from custom post types when they are published.

It's not for BuddyBoss Platform :( , you can find similar option within their plugin.
